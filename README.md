# Activated-Sludge-Models

This repository contains the different Activated Sludge Models developed between [Lund University](https://www.iea.lth.se/) and [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/english/research/prosys). Different implementations are currently available 

<strong>1. ASM1, 2d and 3 implemented in BSM1 </strong>  

This implementation of ASM1, 2d and 3 account implemented in the BSM1 layout accounts for 1) reactive settling and 2) electron dependency. The Main developers are: [Xavier Flores-Alsina](https://github.com/xfalsina), Krist V. Gernaey, and [Ulf Jeppsson](https://github.com/ulfjeppsson). The model is described in the following paper authored by the model developers: [Benchmarking biological nutrient removal in wastewater treatment plants: influence of mathematical model assumptions](https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2012.039
). This version of the model is adapated to be run in Matlab 2019b.
