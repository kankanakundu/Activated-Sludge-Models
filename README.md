# Activated-Sludge-Models

This repository contains the different Activated Sludge Models implementations developed between [Lund University](https://www.iea.lth.se/) and [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/english/research/prosys). Different implementations are currently available 

<strong>1. ASM1, 2d and 3 implemented in BSM1 </strong>  

This implementation of ASM1, 2d and 3 account implemented in the BSM1 layout accounts for 1) reactive settling and 2) electron dependency. The Main developers are: [Xavier Flores-Alsina](https://github.com/xfalsina),[Krist V. Gernaey](https://github.com/kristgernaey), and [Ulf Jeppsson](https://github.com/ulfjeppsson). The model is described in the following paper: 

[Flores-Alsina X., Gernaey K.V. and Jeppsson, U. (2012).Benchmarking biological nutrient removal in wastewater treatment plants: influence of mathematical model assumptions. Water Sci. Technol., 65(8):1496-1505](https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2012.039). 

This version of the model is adapated to be run in Matlab 2019b (or newer).

<strong>2. ASM1, 2d and 3 implemented in BSM1 (with pH calculations) </strong> 

The previous implementation is upgraded with a aqueous phae chemistry models accounting for 1) ion pairing and 2) activity corrections. The latter allow to predict weak-acid base conditions and therefor pH. The main developers are :[Xavier Flores-Alsina](https://github.com/xfalsina), Christian Kazadi Mbamba, [Kimberly Solon](https://github.com/KimberlySolon), Darko Vrecko, Stephan Tait, [Damien J Batstone](https://github.com/damienbatstone), [Ulf Jeppsson](https://github.com/ulfjeppsson), [Krist V. Gernaey](https://github.com/kristgernaey). The model is described in the following paper: 

[Flores-Alsina X, Kazadi-Mbama C., Solon K., Vrecko D., Tait S., Batstone D., Jeppsson U. and Gernaey K.V. (2015). A plant wide aqueous phase chemistry module describing pH variations and ion speciation/pairing in wastewater treatment models. Water Research, 85, 255-265](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2015.07.014). 

This version of the model is adapated to be run in Matlab 2019b (or newer).
